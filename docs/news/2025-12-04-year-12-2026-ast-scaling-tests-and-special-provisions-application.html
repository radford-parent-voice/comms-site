      <h1>Year 12 2026 AST Scaling Tests and Special Provisions Application</h1>
      <p class="muted"><em>Published: 04 Dec 2025</em></p>
      <hr />
      <p>Dear 2026 Year 12 Parents and Carers,</p><p>Congratulations to your child on completing Year 11!</p><p>I write with information for our 2026 BSSS (Board of Senior Secondary Studies) Tertiary students relating to the ACT Scaling Test (AST). The AST is a test designed by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) to facilitate the comparison of T and H Course scores both within and across colleges. If your child is seeking an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) as part of a Tertiary program, they will be required to sit the AST in Term 3, 2026. The AST result does not contribute directly to a student’s ATAR, but it plays a part in the scaling process used to determine it.</p><p>The dates for the tests are <strong>Tuesday, 25 August and Wednesday, 26 August 2026</strong>. Please ensure you do not book holidays or request leave for your child on these days, as a resit will not be approved by the BSSS.</p><p>The AST comprises 3 tests over 2 days – multiple choice, short answer and a writing task. It measures a student’s general scholastic ability to solve problems and make justified decisions in verbal and quantitative areas, as well as their ability to produce an argument in an extended piece of writing. All students have begun their preparation for the AST via Aspire and through the completion of several practise tests conducted on Moderation Days. A total of 4 additional practise tests will be completed in 2026, and our Aspire program will continue to support students in their preparation.</p><p>It is important to ensure that all students have equal opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. Special provisions in the AST are granted by the BSSS in the context of the types of tests used, and are designed to provide equity and access, not advantage. Depending on the type of disability and associated functional difficulties experienced by the student, alternate assessment strategies may be appropriate. These may include additional time to work, rest or move, a scribe, a reader, large-print papers, and the use of special equipment such as laptops. While AST special provisions are informed by a student’s existing school-based supports, the BSSS determines AST provisions independently. To be eligible, students must submit an application to the BSSS. Applications close on <strong>31 March 2026</strong>.</p><p><strong>Evidence required to support the application includes:</strong></p><p>• Evidence of a diagnosed disability, medical condition or disorder, completed by the student’s doctor or another medical practitioner.<br />• Current evidence (no older than September 2024) of the functional impact of the condition. Students will need to provide the email address of a medical practitioner who can support their claim via an online form.<br />• Evidence of existing school-based provisions already provided to the student.</p><p>Further information is available on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bsss.act.edu.au/act_senior_secondary_system/assessment,_scaling_and_the_atar/act_scaling_test_ast" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>ACT BSSS website</strong></a>.</p><p>If you would like to receive an application for your child, please contact Maddie Keogh at <a class="decorated-link cursor-pointer" href="mailto:maddie.keogh@radford.act.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>maddie.keogh@radford.act.edu.au</strong></a>.</p><p>Alternatively, if you have any questions, please contact Alison Steven at <a class="decorated-link cursor-pointer" href="mailto:alison.steven@radford.act.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>alison.steven@radford.act.edu.au</strong></a>.</p><p>Wishing you and your families a restful summer break.</p>
