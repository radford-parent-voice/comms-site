      <p>Welcome to term 1 for 2026 with RDA! Please find in this post some quick notes/info as we head into the new year of dance 🩰</p><p><strong>Class Confirmation Emails</strong></p><p>All families should have now received a class confirmation for each class their child is enrolled in. These emails state when and where the class takes place and what the procedure before and after their class is. If you have not received an email please get in touch.</p><p><strong>Enrolments/Trial Period</strong></p><p>All RDA classes have a 2 week trial period, if we do not hear from you to withdraw by the time the 3rd class starts, your child will be enrolled for the year and t's &amp; c's will apply for withdrawing mid year. Enrolments for RDA classes stay open until the end of term 2, and you can enrol by filling out the EOI form here on Nexus.</p><p><strong>Class Start Date</strong></p><p>All RDA classes will start in week 2, term 1 with the first classes beginning from Monday February 9th. You will need to arrange alternate after school supervision for week 1. </p><p><strong>Uniform</strong></p><p>Please check the RDA Uniform list (found in files on RDA Nexus Page) for what is required for each dance style. The compulsory dance shoes are not required during the trial period for classes, but students should wear something comfortable to dance in and will be in bare feet or school shoes. After the trial period, students must have the correct dance shoes and bring them to each lesson. </p><p>All RDA uniform items and dance shoes should be purchased from our approved supplier - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.canberradancewear.com.au/product-category/uniforms/uniforms-radford-dance-academy/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canberra Dancewear By Dee</a></p><p><strong>RDA Welcome Event &amp; Pop Up Shop</strong></p><p>We will once again hold a welcome event and pop up shop. Friday February 20th, 3:30 to 6pm. We will have a free BBQ, RDA staff around to chat with and answer any questions, and a chance for you to catch up with other RDA families. </p><p>Canberra Dancewear will also hold a pop up shop, so you can get all your dance items.</p><p><strong>Changerooms</strong></p><p>A reminder that any students getting changed for dance when over at the dance studios should use the allocated changerooms in the TB Millar Hall, and not the toilets. </p><p><strong>Communication</strong></p><p>RDA will primarily communicate using this Nexus page, so keep an eye on here for information. If you have any questions we recommend looking in the RDA information booklet for guidance or please to reach out to the RDA team.</p><p><strong>Showcase</strong></p><p>Our 2026 Showcase dates are scheduled as per the below (subject to change and with rehearsals in the weeks prior). More information will be sent out later in the year, but please note these down now to avoid clashing events. </p><p><span style="font-family:Aptos, sans-serif;">Friday November 20 – Tempo Show (Private Lesson Students and Troupes)</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Aptos, sans-serif;">Saturday November 21 – 1pm Beat Show (PreK to Year 2), 6:30pm Pulse Show (Year 3+)</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Aptos, sans-serif;">Saturday November 28 - 1pm Beat Show (PreK to Year 2), 6:30pm Pulse Show (Year 3+)</span></p><p> </p><p>We hope you all enjoy your year of dance with RDA and we can't wait to see you in class soon!😀</p>
