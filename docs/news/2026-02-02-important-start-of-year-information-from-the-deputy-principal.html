      <p>Dear Parents and Carers,</p><p>Welcome to the 2026 school year. I trust you all had a relaxing break and are ready for the year ahead.</p><p>As we begin the new year, it is important that we reiterate the standards we expect of students with regard to uniform from day one. Below is a letter outlining the uniform requirements. Your support in helping your child/ren ensure they adhere to this policy is greatly appreciated.</p><h3><strong>Mobile phones and devices</strong></h3><p>There has been a significant change to our school policy on mobile phones and devices, including smart watches, which will take effect from the commencement of the 2026 academic year.</p><p>Below there is a letter outlining:</p><ul><li>the updated policy, and</li><li>the expectations that apply from today.</li></ul><p>Your support in discussing this new policy with your child/ren, and helping them to self-manage and self-regulate, will ensure a smooth transition back to school and help prevent any unnecessary issues relating to mobile device use.</p><p>It is important that students take responsibility and accountability for their device/s use and understand that, regardless of year level:</p><ul><li>no phones or devices are to be used while at school.</li></ul><p>We require all families to <strong>complete an EdSmart form by Friday, 6 February</strong> to acknowledge they have read and understand the updated policy. The EdSmart form will be sent to families at 10:30 am today.</p><p>If this form is not returned:</p><ul><li>students will be unable to collect their phone should it be confiscated, and</li><li>a parent will be required to collect the device.</li></ul><h3><strong>Communication</strong></h3><p>We have heard your feedback regarding communication at the College and understand that it can feel overwhelming or underwhelming at times. In the coming weeks, I will be communicating a more streamlined approach to how we share information with you, ensuring that:</p><ul><li>you are kept up to date, and</li><li>you can easily find what you need.</li></ul><p>I look forward to the year ahead and working in partnership with you to ensure our entire community is striving for excellence in all that we do. Your ongoing support as we navigate the year is greatly appreciated.</p>
