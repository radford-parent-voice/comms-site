      <p>Dear Parents and Carers of Year 11 and 12 Students,</p><p>I am writing to advise you of the College’s Student Parking Policy, effective from the commencement of the 2026 school year. The purpose of this policy is to ensure the safety of students, staff, families and visitors by reducing on-site traffic congestion and managing student vehicle movements on and around the campus.</p><p>This policy applies to all students who drive to school and to student vehicles entering the school grounds at any time.</p><h2>Overview of the policy</h2><p>From the start of the school day until dismissal:</p><ol><li><strong>No student is permitted to park a vehicle on the school site at any time</strong> unless an approved exception has been granted in advance.</li><li><strong>Students who drive to school must park in the CIT car park.</strong> Residential streets in Bruce are not an alternative. Students are expected to comply with all road rules, parking signage and local regulations, and to behave respectfully as representatives of the College.</li></ol><p>Limited exceptions may be approved in specific circumstances, as outlined in the policy. This includes the after-school 3.40 pm rule for students attending co-curricular activities.</p><h2>On-site parking is a privilege, not a right</h2><p>It is important to note that on-site parking is a privilege and will be approved only in limited circumstances where safety and operational requirements can be maintained. Most schools across Australia do not provide on-site student or staff parking. Our community is fortunate to have any on-site access, and this must be managed carefully. The College must prioritise safe drop-off and pick-up zones, pedestrian movement, buses, emergency access and visitor accessibility. This approach is designed to keep our campus safe and orderly for everyone.</p><p>To support clear expectations and consistent procedures, the following documents (attached) accompany this policy:</p><ul><li>Student &amp; Parent Parking Policy Acknowledgement</li><li>Student On-Site Parking Exception Application Form</li></ul><p>If your child drives to school and requires access to the school grounds after 3.40 pm or is applying for an exception, please ensure you read the policy together and return the acknowledgement as directed by the College.</p><p>Thank you for your support in maintaining a safe and orderly campus environment.</p>
