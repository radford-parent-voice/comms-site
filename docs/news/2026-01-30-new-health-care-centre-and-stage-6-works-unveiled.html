This relocation significantly improves accessibility, visibility and support for student wellbeing.</p><p>'The Health Care Centre provides a calm, professional and welcoming environment where students can receive timely medical support with dignity and privacy,' said Nurse Sophie Davis.</p><p><a href="/storage/image.php?hash=650bf920c3685918aacfdaf8b4918065658360a0"><img class="image_resized" style="aspect-ratio:2048/1366;width:913px;" src="/storage/image.php?hash=650bf920c3685918aacfdaf8b4918065658360a0" alt="Health_Care_Center_09" width="2048" height="1366" /></a></p><p>We are very grateful to the Radford College Foundation for making this project possible.</p><p>'The Foundation was honoured to fund the project. The Health Care Centre delivers a fit-for-purpose facility that supports the College’s strong commitment to student-focused services,' said Foundation Chair Alistair Coe.</p><p><a href="/storage/image.php?hash=395d19a7203827fe7b00e415ce9d84a2e1c008ca"><img class="image_resized" style="aspect-ratio:2048/1366;width:913px;" src="/storage/image.php?hash=395d19a7203827fe7b00e415ce9d84a2e1c008ca" alt="Health_Care_Center_03" width="2048" height="1366" /></a></p><p>Associated internal modifications to the Administration Building were completed to support the relocation of HR and Finance staff, improving staff amenity and access. The relocation of the Boardroom and enrolments team to the Principal’s Building was undertaken separately as part of broader planning to support improved functionality across the College.</p><p><strong>Stage 6 Development Project</strong></p><p>The Stage 6 Development Project represents a significant investment in our co-curricular programs. Funded by donations and the College, works include new oval lighting, a new cricket practice area and storage sheds (under construction), additional tree planting and retaining walls – enhancing the sporting and learning experience of students for generations to come.</p><p><a href="/storage/image.php?hash=e144dad86f5e049fb2f659d2109d9b39a0444d18"><img class="image_resized" style="aspect-ratio:2048/1366;width:913px;" src="/storage/image.php?hash=e144dad86f5e049fb2f659d2109d9b39a0444d18" alt="Drop_Off_02" width="2048" height="1366" /></a></p><p>A key feature of Stage 6 is Collegians Avenue, which runs between the ovals and connects the campus to the College Street kiss-and-drop area. Featuring a striking canopy and trees donated by our families, the avenue creates a shaded, welcoming entrance and walkway.</p><p>I sincerely thank our staff and contractors who worked tirelessly over the holiday period to complete both projects in time for the start of the 2026 school year. I look forward to seeing our students make full use of these new and improved spaces.</p><p>'These projects reflect a strong focus on functionality, safety and long-term value,' said Facilities Manager Craig Webber. 'Every detail was designed to meet real, day-to-day needs while integrating seamlessly into the campus.'</p><p><a href="/storage/image.php?hash=0398fbc2e7a0631b05ea160e84ed1461282a0c56"><img class="image_resized" style="aspect-ratio:2048/1366;width:912px;" src="/storage/image.php?hash=0398fbc2e7a0631b05ea160e84ed1461282a0c56" alt="Drop_Off_08" width="2048" height="1366" /></a></p><p><strong>Pavilion Project</strong></p><p>Looking ahead, the Pavilion Project will deliver a modern sporting hub for students and the wider community. The development includes new changerooms and equipment storage on J.A. Mackinnon Oval, grandstand seating for more than 250 people overlooking the P&amp;F Oval and additional storage for the P&amp;F Oval.</p><p>The Pavilion Project will be unveiled in stages from April to September. The College gratefully acknowledges the generous support of Radford College Foundation Patron Mr Greg Boorer, whose contribution has made this project possible.</p>
