      <h1>Keeping our community safe: traffic and parking at Radford College</h1>

      <p>As school re‑commences, we remind parents and carers to please drive and park safely and legally at and around Radford College. Access Canberra has notified us that mobile speed and parking vans will be in operation.</p><p>In addition to adhering to speed limits, please ensure you park safely – including not parking across pedestrian crossings, in no‑stopping zones, on corners or verges, or double‑parking. Unsafe and illegal parking reduces visibility for both students and motorists and creates significant hazards. We all have an important role to play in supporting road safety. Let’s work together to keep our students safe.</p><h2><strong>Speed limits on campus</strong></h2><ul><li>The speed limit around the Junior School, where children as young as 4 are exiting vehicles, is <strong>10 km/h</strong>.</li><li>The speed limit elsewhere on campus is <strong>20 km/h</strong>.</li></ul><p>Drivers caught speeding or using a device while driving on campus will be reported, and appropriate action will be taken.</p><h2><strong>Junior School <u>morning</u> movements</strong></h2><p>During busy morning periods, please move all the way along the drop‑off and pick‑up bays to support efficient traffic flow.</p><ul><li><strong>Pre‑Kindergarten and Kindergarten:</strong> Use the designated pick‑and‑go area in front of the Junior School, where staff provide assistance.</li><li><strong>All Year 1 to 4 students</strong> (regardless of surname) are to use the Chapel car park drop-off area.</li><li><strong>Year 5 and 6 students</strong> may use the College St kiss-and-drop area, Chapel car park or the Turning Circle.</li></ul><h2><strong>Junior School <u>afternoon</u> movements</strong></h2><p>Families of students in Kindergarten to Year 6 are asked <strong>not to arrive before 3:00 pm</strong>. The Junior School pick‑up area is reserved for Pre‑Kindergarten families; early arrivals may be asked to move.</p><ul><li><strong>Surnames A–M: </strong>Pick‑up outside the Junior School pick-and-go area.</li><li><strong>Surnames N–Z: </strong>Pick‑up at the Chapel car park area.</li><li><strong>Year 5 and 6 students </strong>also have the option to be collected from the College Street kiss‑and‑drop.</li></ul><p>Note: No Junior School students are to be collected at the Turning Circle straight after school. Only students waiting for buses should be there. Some co‑curricular groups may arrange collection from the Turning Circle after 4:30 pm.</p><p>Further information can be found in the <a target="_blank" href="https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnexus.radford.act.edu.au%2Fsend.php%3Fid%3D979&amp;data=05%7C02%7Channah.sparks%40radford.act.edu.au%7C89220829d21c4316297208de622c1ea6%7Cb6891a3fa35747cab0d987d4536e9dfe%7C0%7C0%7C639056138818097952%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C4000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=behBO3S17cT1aIGchGhOtrEU2LSqI2GTrdLcbXPzsxg%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noreferrer noopener">Junior School Handbook</a>.</p><h2><strong>Walking your child to class</strong></h2><p>If you would like to walk your child to class, we recommend using the UC carpark and crossing at the College Street traffic lights for a smoother start.  Please follow all parking signage and avoid parking in pick and ride car parks.</p><h2><strong>Secondary School drop‑off and pick‑up</strong></h2><p>Secondary School students should be dropped off and collected at the <strong>Morison Centre</strong>, not at the Turning Circle. Please follow signage for entering and exiting car parks and avoid turning right when leaving the Gossan Hill car park (near the EV charging stations) before 4:00 pm.</p><p>Parents and carers are encouraged to use the <strong>College Street kiss‑and‑drop</strong>.</p><p>If you are dropping off or picking up students for co‑curricular activities, please use the designated areas. Loading zones and ‘keep clear’ areas must not be used.</p><h2><strong>Parking on College grounds</strong></h2><p>Please be mindful of parking signage and avoid parking in:</p><ul><li>staff‑reserved spaces;</li><li>loading zones;</li><li>drop‑off and pick‑up areas;</li><li>‘keep clear’ zones; and</li><li>the Turning Circle, where parking causes congestion during peak times.</li></ul><h2><strong>Pedestrian crossings and safety supervision</strong></h2><p>All students, staff and parents/carers must use pedestrian crossings and follow instructions from safety supervisors.</p><p>We acknowledge that traffic is heavy for 30–40 minutes twice per day and parking is limited, as is the case for many urban schools. Our staff and student supervisors are doing their best to support a smooth traffic flow. Please follow their instructions and treat them respectfully. Allow extra travel time and exercise patience during peak periods.</p><p>If you have questions or concerns regarding drop‑off and pick‑up, please contact:</p><ul><li>Ms <a href="mailto:tracey.markovic@radford.act.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tracey Markovic</a>: Junior School.</li><li>Mr <a href="mailto:james.rogers@radford.act.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Rogers</a>: Secondary School</li></ul><p>Thank you for your cooperation and support.</p>
